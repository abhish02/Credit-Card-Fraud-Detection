# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
OBJECTIVE:
This project is to perform credit card fraud using a hybrid approach of various Machine Learning algorithms such as KNN(K-nearest neighbor),Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.

PROCESS:
1.The Dataset contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
2.Initially EDA(Exploraory Data Analysis) is carried out inorder to know the trend of the dataset.
3.From the results of EDA ,the dataset is unbalanced for 2 categories.
4.Therefore all the algorithms are applied to both balanced and unbalanced data.
5.By the accuracy obtained from all the algorithms,KNN proves accurate in deducting fraudulent transaction and minimizing the number of false alerts.
